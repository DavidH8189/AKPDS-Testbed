This document will serve as a log of all progress I make on this project. It may simply be research, documentation, experimentation, etc. I will try to log anything related to this project I do on any given day.


February 22, 2026:
  Activity: Finished initial setup of this Repository. Looked into potential solutions to identify and track objects via webcam.
  Findings: OpenCV with a HSV mask might be a good place to start. It works with c++ which is the language im most comfortable in.
  Decision: Look further into OpenCV before commiting.
  Resources: n/a
