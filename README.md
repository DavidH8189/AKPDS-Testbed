⏰ Current Status:
I am currently working on another project for a Expo in a month. In the meantime I am researching potential technologies and methods to accomplish functional requirement 1: identifying and tracking an onject of interest within the sensors FOV.


✅ Goal:
The ultimate goal of this project is to advance my technical capabilities and demonstrate skills needed by the Department of Defense, specifically the MDA.


📌 Overview:
The Autonomous Kinetic Point Defense System (AKPDS) is a cyber-physical testbed designed to model the complexities of National Missile Defense. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for a layer within a layered defense system, integrating real-time computer vision, predictive kinematics, and hardware-level cybersecurity to detect, discriminate, and neutralize threats autonomously.
Project Lead: David Harrison III
Inception Date: February 21, 2026


🎯 Mission Objective:
To design, develop, and evaluate a cyber-physical testbed capable of autonomous threat detection, discrimination, and kinetic neutralization. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for a layered defense system, integrating real-time computer vision, predictive kinematics, and hardware-level cybersecurity to model the complexities of National Missile Defense.
